### Problem: Shortage of daily workers
Daily workers are hard to find these days. These have to do a job in a relatively short and limited time, but the amount of time needed to find one might be bigger than the actual time needed to just to the job. Moreover, the daily workers are not very happy with this situation because their clients tend to be lazy and get a well known company to do the job instead of searching for a good daily worker.

### Solution: A platform for people who offer and people who seek services
We propose a platform meant to make it easier for the clients to find a daily worker, and for the workers to find new clients. Thereby, we want to create a waily working market where one can find people who do some sort of jobs or offer himself to do a job.

### Customer segment
Cleaning, Babysitting, Agriculture Workers, Plumber, Electrician etc

### Competion
At the moment, in Romania, the competition is very low. There are some universal platforms ment for goods publicity, without any purpose of exceling on this niche: Publi24,  Olx, La Jumate.

### Our advantage over the competition
_Dedicated, easy to use, friendly_
Our solution will be better that the competition because it will be dedicated to our target audience. Thus we shall analyze all the needs of daily workers or people searching for daily workers and will shape our application for these criteria.

### Key metrics
One of the key metric is the number of users, but only this number is not enough. We will get the amount of time a client is searching for a daily worker and we will also count how many deals have actually been closed. The most important key metric will be the satisfaction of the daily workers, because they are the ones who actually bring value for the application, because they are the actual product sold by the application and we need them to scale.

### Cost structure
The only cost we have to pay is for the domain and hosting the application in the cloud (database and web machines).

### Revenue streams
We will impose our daily workers a fee which represents a percentage of their earnings. We will not tax the clients.

### Validation
We made 2 type of questionarries:

#### CLIENT

We expect a client would use our app at least twice a month. Our predictive persona would be employed, older than 24 and would optionally have children.
He / she would be living in a city with more than 200.000 inhabitants, which would make it more difficult to know particular "daily workers" that they would reach out to in order to solve various problems. Also, living in a big city would mean that our person will be more socially involved (goes out often, has many outdoor opportunities, so spends little time home with children / cleaning).

##### Questions for clients:
1. How old are you?
    Answers: 23 - 38 years.
2. Are you employed?
    Answers: 94% of them were employed.

##### Yes/No answers:

| Question                                                                                                                                                 | Expected YES | Answered YES |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| If I had children, I would prefer to use the app (babysitters rated by other users) instead of relying on a friend to leave them with.                   | < 35% (6)    | 2 (11%)      |
| If something breaks in my house, I try to reach out to someone instead of fixing it myself.                                                              | > 70% (12)   | 10 (55%)     |
| I know who to reach out to for fixing broken stuff in my house.                                                                                          | < 30% (5)    | 0 (0%)       |
| I go out more than 3 times a week.                                                                                                                       | > 50% (9)    | 9 (50%)      |
| In general, I prefer to reach out to professional workers for any sort of job (Cleaning, Babysitting, Plumber, Electrician etc) rather than improvising. | > 40% (7)    | 14 (77%)     |


#### WORKER

We expect a worker would also find it difficult to find customers, would use the app for a small fee in order to get rid of the searching process, especially since he / she would have the opportunity to set the price for the service offered.

##### Questions for workers:
1. How often do you have to look for customers because there is no work to do at the moment? expected more often than three times a week
    Answers: 80% of them answered “often” and 20% answered “never”.

##### Yes/No answers:

| Question                                                                                                                                            | Expected YES | Answered YES |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| My timetable fills only with regular customers and I don't need to look for more.                                                                   | < 20%        | 1 (20%)      |
| It is easy for me to find customers via friends/other customers.                                                                                    | < 30%        | 1 (20%)      |
| If a matching app for clients <-> workers existed, I would give up a small percentage of my earnings instead of struggling to search for customers. | > 40%        | 4 (80%)      |
| If I were to be given a 1 month free trial and then be prompted to subscribe, I would at least try the app                                          | > 80%        | 4 (80%)      |

#### Comments:
We gave this questionnaire to 18 clients: students, coleagues from work and some friends. Also, we asked 5 people who work as freelancers or do some kind of work on their own and gave them the questionnaire for workers. We asked all of them to be as honest as possible.
Even though the clients didn’t answer as expected the second question, the answers for the last question made us think that they try at first to fix alone the broken things, but, in the final, they know that they need professional help. The fact that all of them answered that they don’t know how to reach any kind of professional help indicates that they really need our application.
The workers’ answers were unexpectedly uniform: 4 of 5 don’t have enough clients and would need our application, but one of them is very sure that he has enough clients and don’t need more. This strongly encourages us to move to the next step.

### Interviews 

We interviewed 3 persons. Two of them are supposed to be clients, the other being the worker.
All 3 of them were interested in using our app so we thought we could get a better idea of
how to improve our design by talking to them.

The interview consisted of the following questions:

1. How many times a month will you be using our app?
2. How would you expect the process to take place?
3. Would you want the history of matches to be kept?
4. What will be the decisive factor that will make you continue using our app?

##### Client 1:
1. As many times as it takes, I am quite tired of trying to reach out to such workers by myself without having
the certainty that they will eventually come and fix my problem.
2. I would like to be able to select my problem, input my address and be found by one of the workers. I would also want
to be able to tell if the worker is serious and usually does a good job. I would not want my problems to turn into
something worse.
3. I think that would be useful. I would like to collaborate with a good worker again.
4. As previously stated, as long as the work gets done quickly and properly, I will keep on using it.

##### Client 2:
1. Every time I need someone to take care of my problems, which means that has to happen fast.
2. I would like the process to be really simple. Probably I will have a profile page and all I would have to do is choose
one particular problem and appear in a list of clients from which workers can choose from. The worker would see the addresses
and choose carefully in order to be there really quick. Also I would like to be able to say no to a worker, if he previously
did poor work. Thus, I think a rating system would be useful.
3. Not necessarily, but I think it could help if you ever want to choose a particular worker for some similar job
4. Good and quick work from the matching workers.

##### Worker:
1. As often as possible, since I am not quite able to find work myself. My hope is I will be more efficient in my activity
when the app gets launched.
2. I would like to see lists of open jobs where the address is very obvious so I can also optimize my routes and be at the
clients on time.
3. From my point of view, not necessarily, but I do not think it would be a problem if that is kept.
4. I expect to find jobs quickly. If that does not happen, I will probably look for a better option. But after I manage to
solve certain people's problems, maybe that will make them become regulars.

#### User persona
Name: Alex
Background:
	Age: 27
	Status: employed in the corporate environment
	Education: graduated a university
	Location: based in Bucharest
	Mannerisms: modern, passionate about technology, socially active, "time is money" driven person
	Issues: little time to spend outside work, needs to automate certain processes in his day-to-day life

#### User stories resulted from the interviews:
1. As a client, I want to be able to rate a worker's performance (1-5 stars?)
2. As a client, I want to be able to refuse a worker based on his rating.
3. As a worker, I would like a list of clients to be displayed so I can choose a job based on the address in order to optimize
the routes.

#### User flows:

Client: Registers -> fills in profile details when he/she has a problem -> picks a problem from a list and is inserted into a list that
the workers can see -> is matched to a worker -> accepts/denies -> can rate the worker.
Worker: Registers -> fills his job type -> chooses a client from a list -> can be rated

#### Sub-markets
We address 2 different sub-markets, namely:
workers: people willing to find a daily job using our application
clients: people willing to find a daily worker suited to their needs and expectations through our platform

#### Competitors
In the targeted market we do not have direct competition, due to the fact that at the current moment there are no dedicated platforms for the problem we address. However, there are 3 online platforms which allow users to publish different announcements and our targeted clients and workers may use these platforms too.

The competions
*La jumate
*OLX
*Publi24

#### Our estimated potential market share in year 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 after launch
We estimate that our potential market share in the next 5 years will be 100%, considering that there are no direct competitors. In case there will be similar applications, we will reestimate the market share, according to the given context. 

#### The total market value and the value of our market share for years 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
